# Interaction
[Discussion Link](https://github.com/orgs/sit-dia/discussions/14)

## Viewpoint Control
- Basically controlling the camera
- Is a **passive** interaction
- Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) use accelerometers and gyroscopes to determine where a device is in 3D space
> - Viewpoint control in VR typically involves the following aspects:
> -Positional Tracking: VR systems often use sensors or cameras to track the user's head movements in real-time, allowing them to change their position within the > -virtual environment by moving their head. This enables users to look around and explore the virtual world from different angles.

> - Orientation Control: Users can also rotate their viewpoint by turning their head or using input devices such as controllers to change their orientation within the virtual environment. This allows them to view the surroundings from different perspectives.

> - Teleportation or Locomotion: In addition to natural movement, VR applications may offer alternative methods of navigation such as teleportation or simulated > -walking. These techniques allow users to move to different locations within the virtual space, expanding their ability to explore and interact with the > -> -environment.

> - Scale and Proximity Control: Some VR experiences allow users to dynamically adjust their scale within the virtual environment or manipulate their proximity to objects. This feature can be useful for examining details, interacting with objects, or adapting the environment to fit personal preferences.

## Hand Gestures
- Haptic Gloves
- Computer Vision-based Finger Tracking
- Dedicated VR controllers

## Body Gestures
- Embodiment: "the feeling of being in control of a virtual representation of the human self"
> - Perception that a virtual body is one's own. Often correlated to Presence
- Hand gestures are partial embodiment, because only the hands are being controlled
- IMU Trackers
- 360 degree treadmills
- Haptic suits
- No real desktop replacement using desktop modalities (e.g. keyboard, mouse) to give embodiment

## Interaction Authenticity
- Interaction Authenticity: "the consideration of whether the desired experience should be natural or artificial"

### Natural Interactions
- Natural Interactions: "interactions where the outcome is very close to what is done in the real world"
> - Natural interaction offers the most optimal interaction authenticity

### Artificial Interactions
- Artificial Interactions: "interactions that are imossible in the real world"

#### Magical Interactions
- Plausibility Illusion: "events that happen in the virtual world closely affects the perception of how credible these things can actually happen IRL"
- Having the Plausibility Illusion is the key to providing an immersive experience for the user
- E.g literally controlling the flow of time by moving (Superhot)

#### Augmented Natural Interactions
- Allows users to perform higly exaggerated versions of a familiar IRL action
- E.g. super high jumps in video games

## Interaction Use Cases

### GUI Interactions
- GUI = Graphical User Interface
- HUD = Heads Up Display
- HMD = Head Mounted Device

#### E.g. Meta Quest 2
-  An "all-in=one" VR HMD, where all selections and menu interactions are displayed in the VR display itself
- It uses Viewpoint Control & Hand Gestures 
- Creates a laser pointer ray, acting as an extension of the VR controllers, to click options in the menu with a trigger button

#### E.g. Google Cardboard
- Makes finger point at things by using Viewpoint Control, known as Gaze Control (because there are no controllers)
- Clicks in menus are done by staring at menu options long enough [Editor's Note: THAT'S HILARIOUS.]

### Locomotion Interactions
- Locomotion Interactions: "the ability to perform spatial navigation in the virtual environment"
- Can be pretty tricky to get right, especially with IRL spatial constaints (the room you're in can only be so big before bumping into stuff)
- Can be done by combining Viewpoint Control, Hand Gestures and Body Gestures
- Alternatively, users can move around with just teleporting from place to place instead, but that hampers Immersion a lot
